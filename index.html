                 In 2008, my father re-enlisted in the military and his duty station was Honolulu, located on the Island of Oahu in Hawaii. As a dependent, I took the opportunity to move to Hawaii with my parents and I lived there for 2 years. Specifically, we resided about 8 minutes from downtown Honolulu in an area called Aiea.

               <p class="center large">The Annual State Fair is what I miss most about living in Hawaii. There were so many wonderful stage performances with meet and greets and circus acts to enjoy. I met several dance groups from the MTV dance competition television show, America’s Best Dance Crew, which was very popular during that time. Most people remember the winners of the first season of the show, the Jabbawockeez, the most.

               <p class="center large"> Also, at the State Fair, there was so many food options from the traditional fair favorites like hot dogs, funnel cakes, deep-fried corn, and popcorn to pork steaks, roasted and fried chicken, and BBQ cuisine to authentic Hawaiian foods, Thai dishes, and other specialty cuisines The Hawaiian State Fair is really a foodies' paradise.

            <p class="center large"> I also miss trips to Ala Moana mall, checking out beautiful artwork, vintage antiques, Hawaiian souvenirs, handcrafted items, and jewelry at the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet, and living within 15 minutes to the ocean.
