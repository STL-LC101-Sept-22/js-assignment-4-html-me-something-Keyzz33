             "In 2008, my father reenlisted in the military and his duty station was Honolulu, located on the Island of Oahu in Hawaii. As a dependent, I took the opportunity to move to Hawaii with my parents and I lived there for 2 years. Specifically, we resided about 8 minutes from downtown Honolulu in an area called Aiea."

               "I lived in military housing about a 30 minute drive from Scofield Military base. This may seem like a long time but driving anywhere on the island always felt much quicker when compared to driving around St. Louis, Missouri. I think one key difference is the laid-back happy-go-lucky culture in Hawaii. In my two years there I very rarely saw incidents of road rage or many car accidents overall."

               "There was a lot of sightseeing and adventures I went on during my time in Hawaii. One was swimming with dolphins, an excursion inside of the marine park and aquarium located on southeast side of Oahu, Sea Life Park."
